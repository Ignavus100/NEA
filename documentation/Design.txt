    -Using AI which already exists
    -All legal

Design
    -Make an AI that can take verbal statergies and implement them in my code
    -Give the user a success rate based on past apperances in the data from Polygon API
    -Return the code that they can use themselves in another software (use pine script for tradingview as it is the biggest platform) based on the success rates
    -Give an option to watch the program in action on a graph
    -Give the percent success based on the previous runs
    -When running the version that they can see, add relevant graphs e.g. RSI compared with another graph
