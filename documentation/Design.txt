    -All legal*
    -I have done some testing and it looks like i can get this finished by the summer if all goes well

Design
    -Make an AI that can take verbal statergies and implement them in my code
    -Give the user a success rate based on past apperances in the data from Polygon API
    -Return the code that they can use themselves in another software (use pine script for tradingview as it is the biggest platform) based on the success rates
    -Give an option to watch the program in action on a graph
    -Give the percent success based on the previous runs
    -When running the version that they can see, add relevant graphs e.g. RSI compared with another graph
    -Account system
    -61% americans try trading 70% fail so there needs to be a gateway
    -Return a program they can use in tradingview

    -Give practice questions on fluctuations to get an estimate of the persons accuracy
