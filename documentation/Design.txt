Analysis
    -Can all be done in python
    -Using data which already exists
    -All legal*
    -I have done some testing and it looks like i can get this finished by the summer if all goes well

Design
    -Make python interface to present the algorithms
    -Host a database using github pages to backtest strategies using SQL
    -Have a "playground" so that people can practice and have an account system (hashing)
    -Make an (AI) or (algorithm) that is very successfull
    -(Take a users algorithm using an interprative AI) or (make an interface for creating an algorihm in code)
    -Show the users or our algorithm in action
